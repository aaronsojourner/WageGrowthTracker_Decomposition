# WageGrowthTracker_Decomposition
By Aaron Sojourner, asojourn@umn.edu

This repository contains code to reproduce my analysis of median wage growth, which builds off the Atlanta Fed's Wage Growth Tracker (WGT) code & version of the CPS data available here: https://www.atlantafed.org/chcs/wage-growth-tracker?panel=4.

I modified the WGT's do files and named them v2. Also added a do file for graphing.
